<!-- 
This slide highlights a group of projects supporting battery modelling and analysis, many of which have been developed in close collaboration with researchers in engineering and energy systems.

First, PyBaMM — the Python Battery Mathematical Modelling library — is an open-source tool for specifying and solving physics-based battery models. It has a large and active user base in both academia and industry, with over 60 contributors. It is now a NumFOCUS-sponsored project, reflecting its maturity and importance within the scientific software community.

Galvanalyser is a platform for collecting and structuring data from lab-scale battery cycling experiments. It supports the FAIR principles by standardising metadata and providing access via a REST API. It is also part of a broader collaboration with EIDF to build an HPC-capable infrastructure for large-scale battery data analysis.

Finally, PyBaMM Optimisation Platform, or PyBOP, is a Python package focused on optimisation and parameterisation of battery models. It helps streamline research workflows and is increasingly used in both academic studies and industrial applications.

Across these projects, OxRSE has contributed to development, infrastructure, and integration efforts — supporting reproducibility, scalability, and user experience.

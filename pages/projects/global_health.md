Global.health is an open, international platform developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It provides access to de-identified, line-listed case data for tracking the progression and spread of infectious diseases — with a focus on supporting response efforts during the critical first 100 days of an outbreak.

The platform has captured over 100 million COVID-19 cases and more than 80,000 Mpox cases, and is used by more than 5000 researchers and public health professionals worldwide.

It has led to several high-impact publications, including in *Nature Computational Science* and *The Lancet Infectious Diseases*.

OxRSE has contributed across all technical aspects of the platform — including frontend and backend development, data pipeline design, and infrastructure provisioning. Technologies used include MongoDB, AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

This work reflects the group’s ability to contribute to large-scale, production-grade research software used in real-world public health decision-making.

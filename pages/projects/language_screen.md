        LanguageScreen (LS) is a mobile app developed with education researchers to assess young children’s language skills. It supports early language interventions in schools and led to the OxEd & Assessment spin-out: <a href="https://oxed-assessment.com/" class="link">oxed-assessment.com</a>.
        <br /><br />LS played a critical role in the Nuffield Early Language Intervention (NELI) programme, a 20-week evidence-based intervention that was part of the UK government's 2020 COVID-19 education recovery package.<br /><br /> Thousands of schools across the UK adopted the LanguageScreen app to identify children in Reception year who would benefit from additional support in developing their oral language skills.

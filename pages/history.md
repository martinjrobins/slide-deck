The Oxford RSE Group was established in December 2018 within the Department of Computer Science, supported initially through EPSRC IAA funding, which allowed us to start with three full-time RSEs for one year.

In 2022, we joined the Doctoral Training Centre — a move that better reflects our interdisciplinary collaborations and allows us to work more closely with research groups across the University.

Our funding model is now fully self-sustaining. We have 14 RSEs on open-ended contracts, supported through direct project income and strategic partnerships.

Since launch, we've supported 144 research projects and grant proposals. Of these, 81 have secured funding, bringing in nearly £5 million in research income.

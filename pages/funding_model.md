<!-- 
There are two primary ways to fund work with us.

For longer-term collaborations, we are typically costed into research grants at the standard University rate for a Grade 8.3 postdoc. 

For shorter work or when funds are already available,  we can be costed through the University's Small Research Facility mechanism, using our day rate.

You can contact us through our online project request form, and we’re always happy to advise on which model best suits your needs.

<!-- 
We offer a broad programme of training to support researchers in developing the skills needed to build and maintain effective research software.

We maintain an open-access collection of online training materials, available at train.rse.ox.ac.uk, which researchers can work through at their own pace.

In addition to that, we run regular in-person courses, which are open to all University staff and students. These sessions are delivered by members of our team and cover both foundational and advanced topics.

Courses range from introductory programming and version control, through to more advanced areas such as software design, architecture, tooling, and high performance computing.

Upcoming sessions and registration details are always listed on our website at rse.ox.ac.uk/training.

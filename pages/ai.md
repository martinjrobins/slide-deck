# **Support for AI/ML projects**

## **Custom model development**
#### RSEs are experienced in common ML software frameworks (e.g. scikit-learn, pytorch, JAX) {class="ml-8"}

## **High Performance Computing**
#### Scaling up models (e.g. using CUDA, C++, Rust, SIMD) & university clusters (e.g ARC, BMRC) {class="ml-8"}

## **Data curation and management**
#### RSEs can create data pipelines that comply with privacy and reproducible (FAIR) standards {class="ml-8"}

## **Integration of AI tools**
#### integrate AI models into user-friendly platforms (e.g., web apps, APIs) {class="ml-8"}

## **Sustainability and reproducibility**
#### Good software engineering practices (testing, version control, documentation), ensure that AI tools are reliable, reproducible, and can be built upon {class="ml-8"}

## **Training**: [www.rse.ox.ac.uk/training](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/training) 
#### OxRSE runs a regular series of free software engineering courses for students & academics {class="ml-8"}

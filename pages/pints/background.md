# PINTS Background

In many situations, we have a model with parameter values that we need to infer from noisy time-series data.

**PINTS** stands for **P**robabilistic **I**nference on **N**oisy **T**ime-**S**eries.

It is a Python-based tool to tackle inference problems within a probabilistic framework.

```bash
pip install pints
```

**Why PINTS?**

- *Pure python* implementation, easy to install and use
- *Non-opinionated* on forward model implementation, just needs to implement a simple interface
- Provides a wide range of *optimisers, samplers, likelihoods and error functions*

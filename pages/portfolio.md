<!-- 
Our project portfolio spans a broad range of areas, reflecting the diversity of research we support.

We work on computational modelling tools used in scientific simulations, helping ensure they are efficient, reproducible, and aligned with good software practices.

We develop data platforms — from research data infrastructures to custom pipelines and visualisations — supporting collaboration and analysis at scale.

We also build web and mobile applications to support research delivery, engagement, and translation.

The group is involved in the Schmidt AI in Science Programme, for which dedicated RSEs provide software engineering support and training to the programme's fellows.

Finally, we maintain a list of our publications, which can also be found on our website.

Our website also has details about our projects, including links to our GitHub repositories and other resources. I am going to present some of our projects in more detail in the next slides.

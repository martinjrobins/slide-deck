<!-- 
Our mission spans the full research lifecycle, starting from the proposal stage through to impact and translation.

We work with researchers to define, scope, and cost the software effort required in grant applications. This helps strengthen the competitiveness of proposals, particularly for projects where software is a critical component.

Once a project is funded, we collaborate to deliver high-quality, sustainable software that supports research outputs — ensuring results are not only reproducible but also more impactful and reliable.

Beyond direct development, we provide training, consultancy, and code review to help research teams build their own capabilities and work effectively with software as a team.

Ultimately, this work supports the translation and commercialisation of software outputs — making it easier for research software to be adopted, reused, and scaled beyond the original project.

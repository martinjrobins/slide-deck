## **Central pool of Research Software Engineers (RSEs)**

<br />

## Sustainable software for research & innovation<br />without the need to hire dedicated RSEs in your team

<!-- 
Central to our model is the idea of a shared pool of Research Software Engineers — or RSEs — based within the University.

This means researchers can access specialist software engineering expertise without needing to recruit, train, or manage a dedicated RSE within their own team.

It’s a flexible model that enables research groups to bring in the right skills at the right time, supporting both short-term and long-term needs.

It also promotes sustainability and knowledge sharing, helping ensure that the software developed is robust, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.

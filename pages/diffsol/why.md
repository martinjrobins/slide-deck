# Why another ODE solver?

1. **Modern Rust**: 
    - safety guarantees, high performance, great tooling.
    - excellent cross-platform & cross-language support.

1. **Flexibility**: 

    - Supports range of ODEs and DAEs, including stiff & non-stiff systems, with sensitivities.
    - allows users to define custom linear solvers and linear algebra backends.
    - provides multiple high-level and low-level APIs for supplying your system of equations.

1. **Performance**: Gives these benefits without sacrificing performance.
